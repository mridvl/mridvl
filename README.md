## Hey there! 👋

I'm Mridul Shukla — a backend-focused software developer from India 🇮🇳

I build scalable backend systems, secure APIs, and AI-powered automation tools.

If there’s a real-world problem, I enjoy designing the architecture and engineering a production-ready solution for it.

My core tech stack includes NestJS, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Spring Boot (basic), and AWS.  
I also work with Machine Learning models using Python and Scikit-learn.

I've built enterprise-style systems involving:
- Role-based JWT authentication (RBAC)
- Microservices architecture
- Cloud deployment (AWS EC2)
- SQL performance tuning
- AI-driven automation pipelines

Some of my favorite work includes:
• AI Chat Reply Bot (LLM-powered contextual response system)  
• Doctor Appointment Scheduling API (stream & wave logic)  
• Barcode Scanner Web App (3rd-party API integrations)  
• Financial transaction processing system (Kafka-based architecture)

If you're interested in backend engineering, scalable systems, or AI integrations — you’re in the right place.

Fun Facts:
• I enjoy designing clean backend architectures
• I like turning manual workflows into automated systems
• Interested in Distributed Systems & AI Agents
• Always learning something new 🚀
